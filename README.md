# Intcode as a Service

This project runs arbitrary Intcode programs in the cloud.

The [Intcode computer](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/2) is a
concept created by Eric Wastl for his
[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) programming
challenge series. For more information on writing, reading and executing
Intcode programs, feel free to solve the Advent of Code 2019 programming
challenges to grasp the concepts.

This README will be expanded soon to detail the workings of the project.
